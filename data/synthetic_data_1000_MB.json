Here is a natural language version of the transportation order:\n\nDeutsche Telekom needs a big lorry with double drivers for a pickup between 8:15 AM and 7:30 PM on January 25th, 2018. The goods to be delivered include four large packages that weigh around 550 kg each and measure about 150 cm in length, 125 cm in width, and 50 cm in height. All four packages are stackable and must be transported between the delivery locations of COMPANY_PICKUP and COMPANY_DELIVERY on January 27th and 28th, 2018.\n\nThe pickup will take place between 8:15 AM and 7:30 PM on January 25th at ZIP_PICKUP with the company name COMPANY_PICKUP. The delivery will occur between 10:30 PM and 3:30 AM on January 27th and 28th at ZIP_DELIVERY with the company name COMPANY_DELIVERY.\n\nPlease note that double drivers are required for this transportation order, as the goods are too heavy to be carried by a single driver. Additionally, the lorry must be big enough to accommodate all four packages comfortably. Thank you for your help with this request!",

This one comes with some special requests, so pay close attention. We need you to pick up the goods on behalf of COMPANY_PICKUP at their location in CITY_PICKUP as soon as possible (ASAP).  \n\nOnce you've gotten everything loaded up, we need you to take it to DELIVERY in CITY_DELIVERY by December 15th, 2034, at 2:00 AM. The package includes three shipments that are as follows:\n\nThe first is a large (96 kg) rectangular box measuring approximately 13 meters long, 36 meters wide, and 29 meters high; it will need to be secured with sideboards for transport.  \n\nThe second parcel weighs about 74 kg and measures 95 meters long, 99 meters wide, and 24 meters tall. It's a bit more straightforward than the first one but still needs its own set of sideboards to keep it secure during transit.   \n\nLastly, there's an even smaller box weighing only about 18 kg measuring approximately 71 meters long, 21 meters wide, and 73 meters high.  \n\nAll three packages need to be transported using a large vehicle like an LKW because of their size and weight. Please make sure that you have a suitable vehicle available before accepting this order so we can avoid any delays or issues during transit. As always, thank you for your help with this request; we appreciate your business and look forward to working together again soon!",

We've got a transportation order for you, so grab a pen and paper and let's dive in. \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFirst up, we've got a pickup to take care of. It's from COMPANY_PICKUP (that's their company name, not their actual name - wink). They're located at ZIP_PICKUP, and the country is COUNTRY_PICKUP. We need to swing by ASAP, so make sure you've got your schedule open. \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\n\nNext up, we've got a delivery to make. It's to COMPANY_DELIVERY, and their address is ZIP_DELIVERY in COUNTRY_DELIVERY. We'll be dropping off the goods on December 15th at 20:00:00, so make sure you've got that date circled in your calendar. \ud83d\udcc5\n\nNow, about those goods. We've got a weight of 34 kg and dimensions of 14cm x 22cm x 16cm, so make sure you've got enough space in the truck. And hey, we're in luck! This one's stackable, so if you can fit a few more on top, go for it! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nOh, and just to let you know, we need a big lorry for this job. No, not just any big lorry - we need one that can do a round trip. So, if you've got one of those handy, give us a shout! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udc4b\n\nAlright, that's it for the details. We hope you're ready to rock and roll (or should we say, \"roll on\"? \ud83d\ude05). We'll be waiting for your confirmation before we can get this show on the road! \ud83d\ude97\ud83d\udca8\n\nSo, what do you say? Are you ready to transport some goods for us? Let us know when you're good to go, and we'll send over the details! \ud83d\ude0a"

We need to pick up some goods from COMPANY_PICKUP on STREET_PICKUP in CITY_PICKUP, ZIP_PICKUP, COUNTRY_PICKUP as soon as possible. The pickup time is ASAP, so please be ready to roll!\n\nWe'll need you to deliver the goods to COMPANY_DELIVERY on STREET_DELIVERY in CITY_DELIVERY, ZIP_DELIVERY, COUNTRY_DELIVERY on October 26th at 17:15. That's right, we need you to deliver these goods on a specific date and time, so make sure your driver is ready to go!\n\nNow, about the goods. We have three packages with different dimensions:\n\n* Package 1: Length 77m, Width 39m, Height 88m, Weight 65kg\n* Package 2: Length 81m, Width 11m, Height 43m, Weight 58kg\n* Package 3: Length 62m, Width 79m, Height 95m, Weight 83kg\n\nAll of them are pretty long and heavy, so we'll need a Sprinter with a tail lift to handle the job. Please make sure your vehicle is equipped with a tail lift, as we cannot accommodate any other type of vehicle.\n\nOh, and one more thing! We need you to provide us with a tracking number as soon as the goods are picked up. That way, we can keep track of the shipment and make sure everything goes smoothly.\n\nThanks for your help, Hilcorp Energy! We appreciate your professionalism and look forward to working with you.\"\n\nI hope this text meets your requirements! Let me know if there's anything else I can do for you."

On November 17th between 11 p.m. and 5:30 a.m., we'll need to collect your shipment from COMPANY_PICKUP in COUNTRY_PICKUP, CITY_PICKUP. Please note that the pick-up will take place within a narrow time window, so make sure you or your team is available during those hours.\n\nOnce we've collected the goods, we'll be heading to COMPANY_DELIVERY in COUNTRY_DELIVERY, CITY_DELIVERY. The delivery will take place between November 20th at 2 a.m. and November 23rd at 1:15 p.m., so please schedule your team accordingly.\n\nNow, let's talk about the goods! We'll be transporting two pieces of equipment with the following dimensions:\n\n* The first piece measures 25 meters in length, 82 meters in width, and 70 meters in height, weighing a whopping 146 kilograms.\n* The second piece measures 80 meters in length, 13 meters in width, and 13 meters in height, with a weight of 92 kilograms.\n\nPlease note that these items are not stackable, so we'll need to transport them separately. Also, since they are quite large, we require a Sprinter vehicle to ensure a smooth and safe transportation process. If possible, we would appreciate it if you could provide sideboards for the vehicles to prevent any damage during transit.\n\nWe understand that this is a complex shipment, but with our expertise and your cooperation, we'll make sure everything goes smoothly. We look forward to working with you!"

Here's a natural language version of your transportation order: \n\nWe have a pickup order for you, and we need your big lorry to come and collect it between 00:15 - 08:30 on Wednesday, July 14th. Please note that the pickup time is not just the date, but a specific time window!\n\nOur client's company name for this order is COMPANY PICKUP, and their postal code is ZIP PICKUP. They need us to collect two shipments of goods, each with unique dimensions (see below). The total weight of these items is 132 kg.\n\nThe first item measures 68 meters long, 81 meters wide, and 53 meters high - quite a large one! It weighs 66 kg. The second item is smaller but still significant: it's 51 meters long, 19 meters wide, and 48 meters high, with a weight of 66 kg as well.\n\nWe need your big lorry because these items are not stackable. Also, please note that we require a round trip for this order, so you must bring the vehicle back to us after delivery. \n\nFor your information, our client needs us to deliver these goods between Thursday, July 15th at 20:30 and Monday, July 26th at 08:30. Please make sure that your driver is available during this time window as well. The delivery address is COMPANY_DELIVERY with a postal code of ZIP_DELIVERY.\n\nLastly, please note the special request we have for this order: we need a round trip. We appreciate your assistance in accommodating this requirement. Thank you for your time and attention to detail! "

We require the use of a Sprinter vehicle for this transportation request.

Your prompt response will be much appreciated!\n\nHow's that? I tried my best to make it as conversational as possible while still being clear about the details of the transportation order.

Yep, that's right! The pickup address is in COUNTRY_PICKUP, CITY_PICKUP, and ZIP_PICKUP. \ud83d\ude04\n\nNow, we'll need to deliver these goods to COUNTRY_DELIVERY, CITY_DELIVERY, and ZIP_DELIVERY on September 4th at 11:00 PM. That's right, folks! The delivery address is in COUNTRY_DELIVERY, CITY_DELIVERY, and ZIP_DELIVERY. \ud83d\ude04\n\nSo, what do we have here? \ud83e\udd14 We have a rather large shipment of goods that weighs approximately 162 kg (that's roughly the weight of an adult hippopotamus! \ud83d\udc0a). These goods come in three packages, each measuring 36 meters long, 126 meters wide, and 66 meters high. Mind you, that's almost as tall as a 20-story building! \ud83d\udcaa\n\nNow, here's the tricky part: we need to transport these goods using a Van with sideboards. That's right, folks! We need a Van with sideboards to ensure the safe and secure transportation of these precious goods. \ud83d\ude05\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our client has specified that the goods are stackable, so we need to be extra careful when loading and unloading them. Think of it like building a tower out of blocks; we need to make sure each layer is stable before adding the next one. \ud83d\udc3e\n\nOh, and did I mention that our client has requested that we use a Van with sideboards? \ud83d\ude05 It's like they know we're going to need all the help we can get! \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo there you have it, folks! That's the transportation order in all its glory. We hope you're ready for this exciting adventure because we sure are! \ud83d\ude01\n\nPickup Time: September 1st at 8:00 PM\nDelivery Time: September 4th at 11:00 PM\nPickup Location: COUNTRY_PICKUP, CITY_PICKUP, ZIP_PICKUP\nDelivery Location: COUNTRY_DELIVERY, CITY_DELIVERY, ZIP_DELIVERY\nGoods Weight: 162 kg\nGoods Dimensions: 36m x 126m x 66m (each package)\nSpecial Requests: Van with sideboards, stackable goods\n\nHappy transporting, everyone! Let's make this a successful delivery! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\ude9a"

We've got a transportation order for you, and we'd love to share all the juicy details with you! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFirst off, we've got a pickup to take care of. Our friendly driver will be swinging by COMPANY_PICKUP on STREET_PICKUP at ASAP (we know, it's super duper urgent! \ud83d\udca8). Don't you worry, they'll be there in a jiffy! \u23f1\ufe0f\n\nOnce they've snatched up those precious goods, they'll be headed over to COMPANY_DELIVERY on STREET_DELIVERY. Our delivery time is set for 2013-06-12 05:30:00 (that's 5:30 AM on June 12th, just in case you were wondering! \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f).\n\nNow, let's talk about the goods themselves! We've got a whopping 192 kg of them, and they're quite the peculiar bunch. They come in two sizes: L (length 15m, width 46m, height 46m, weight 96 kg) and XL (length 41m, width 70m, height 61m, weight 96 kg). Talk about a growth spurt! \ud83e\udd2f\n\nNow, we know what you're thinking - how on earth are we gonna fit all these goods into one vehicle? Don't worry, our trusty small lorry has got this one covered. With its impressive carrying capacity, we can easily squeeze in both sizes of goods and still have some room to spare! \ud83d\ude97\n\nBut wait, there's more! Our special request for this transportation order is a bit of a doozy. We need a frigo (that's refrigerator truck for all you non-French speakers out there!) to keep our precious goods nice and chilly during transit. \u2744\ufe0f\n\nSo there you have it, folks! That's the scoop on this transportation order. We hope you're as excited about it as we are - after all, who doesn't love a good pickup-delivery adventure? \ud83d\ude0f\n\nStay tuned for more updates and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns! \ud83d\udc4d\n\nHappy transporting,\n\nThe Woolworths Group Team \ud83d\udc30"

Here's a natural language version of your transportation order:\n\n\"Hi there, we have a special request for a shipment that needs to be picked up on March 5th at 6:00 AM from COMPANY_PICKUP on STREET_PICKUP in CITY_PICKUP. The delivery will be made on March 9th at 10:00 AM to COMPANY_DELIVERY on STREET_DELIVERY in CITY_DELIVERY.\n\nWe have a shipment of goods that includes several large and heavy items, so we'll need a special refrigerator truck (LKW) with a frigo requirement to transport them safely. The goods have a total weight of 119 kg and the dimensions are quite impressive: the longest item measures 96 meters in length, 70 meters in width, and 70 meters in height, with a weight of 11 kg; the second-longest item is 60 meters long, 88 meters wide, and 52 meters high, with a weight of 47 kg; the third-longest item is 39 meters long, 34 meters wide, and 37 meters high, with a weight of 21 kg; and the shortest item is just 10 meters long, but it's whopping 79 meters wide and 79 meters high, with a weight of 40 kg.\n\nSince these items are so large and heavy, we cannot stack them on top of each other, so we need a special truck that can accommodate them individually. Please note that the pickup and delivery times are not just on the date, but also include the specific time of 6:00 AM for pickup and 10:00 AM for delivery.\n\nWe appreciate your expertise in handling this unique shipment. Thank you!\""

Each one is roughly 33 cm long, 66 cm wide, and 39 cm high, and they weigh around 117 kg each. That's a total of 351 kg! \ud83d\udca5 So, you'll need a big lorry to haul 'em around. \ud83d\ude9a\n\nWe need you to deliver these babies to CITY_DELIVERY on September 21st at 5 AM. That's right - we're talking about a whole week of transportation magic! \u2728 And, just so you know, we've got some pretty specific requests this time around. We need a frigo truck (that's refrigerator truck for all you non-Aussies out there!) to keep our goods nice and chilly during the journey. \ud83e\udd76\n\nSo, what do ya say, Macquarie Group? You up for the challenge? Let us know when you're ready to roll (literally! \ud83d\ude02), and we'll get these packages on their way pronto! \ud83d\ude80"

run` - Run the application\n* `docker-compose config` - Display configuration options\n* `docker-compose exec` - Execute a command in the container\n* `docker-compose logs` - View the logs of the containers\n* `docker-compose scale` - Scale the containers\n* `docker-compose pause` - Pause the Composing\n* `docker-compose resume` - Resume the Composing\n* `docker-compose stop` - Stop the Composing\n* `docker-compose rm` - Remove the Composing\n\nNote: You can also use `docker-compose` without specifying the command, it will automatically detect the command you want to run.\n```\n\nThis will allow you to use the `docker-compose` command in your scripts and automate the process of working with Docker Compose files."

Our team will be picking up a shipment of goods from COMPANY_PICKUP at STREET_PICKUP in CITY_PICKUP on Thursday, September 26th at 2:00 AM. The shipment consists of one item with the following dimensions: 23 meters long, 37 meters wide, and 47 meters high, weighing 31 kilograms. We'll be delivering it to COMPANY_DELIVERY at STREET_DELIVERY in CITY_DELIVERY on Saturday, September 28th at 2:00 AM.\n\nPlease note that the goods are quite large and heavy, so we'll need a big lorry to transport them safely. We also require a double driver for this trip, as the dimensions of the shipment make it difficult to maneuver. If you can provide us with a vehicle that meets these specifications, we'll be able to complete the delivery on time and without any issues.\n\nWe understand that this is a bit of an unusual request, but we appreciate your help in making sure our clients receive their shipments promptly and in good condition. Thank you for your cooperation!\""

It's gonna be on June 12th between 00:30 and 01:30, so make sure you swing by then! \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f\n\nNow, once you've got the goods, we need ya to deliver 'em to COMPANY_DELIVERY over at STREET_DELIVERY in CITY_DELIVERY, ZIP_DELIVERY. But here's the thing: we need it done between June 13th and June 17th from 17:00 to 20:30. That's a pretty long window, but hey, we know you can do it! \ud83d\ude0e\n\nNow, let's talk about the goods themselves. We've got a weight of 79 kg and some pretty impressive dimensions: 31m long, 40m wide, and 63m high (that's like, really tall, dude! \ud83e\udd2f). Oh, and just so you know, these babies are gonna be a bit tricky to handle, so we need ya to use a Sprinter (you know, the kind with the fancy curtain sides? \ud83d\ude97). And if you could tilt that bad boy for us, we'd really appreciate it! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nSo there you have it, folks! That's our transportation order in all its glory. We know you can handle it, so go ahead and get to work! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc\n\nOh, and one more thing: we really appreciate your help with this one, so if you could give us a shout-out on social media or something, that'd be awesome! \ud83d\udcf1\ud83d\udc4d We're gonna make sure to tag ya in all our future orders, too! \ud83d\ude09"
